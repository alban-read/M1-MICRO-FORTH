### This is a non standard VARIANT of FORTH

This FORTH is implemented in AARCH64 assembly language (main.asm), and runs under OSX on the Apple M1.

FORTH primitives are implemented as assembly language functions, the compiler converts high level FORTH words into tokens for a token interpreter to execute.
