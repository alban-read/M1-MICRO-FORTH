## Thoughts

AARCH64 is suprisingly different to ARM32


### Inspiration

Inspired by FORTH.

### purpose

Learn ARM64, have some fun, create useful things.


### approach

create small machine code primitive words 

 .. allow them to be tested interactively

 .. allow new words to be composed, mainly by concatenation.


### expedience

It is ok to start by using the standard C library to get up and running.

Later may migrate to only use system calls.

ASCII text is used for function names and vaiables, not Unicode

Unicode will be supported only in strings when they are added
